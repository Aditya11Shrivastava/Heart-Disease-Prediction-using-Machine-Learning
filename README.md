Insights:

High Accuracy: The logistic regression model achieved an impressive accuracy of 87% on both the training and testing datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease.

Key Features: Features such as age, chest pain type, maximum heart rate achieved, and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak) were significant predictors of heart disease.

Model Evaluation: The confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score provided a comprehensive evaluation of the model, confirming its reliability in distinguishing between patients with and without heart disease.

Data Preprocessing: Effective data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection played a crucial role in enhancing the model's performance.

Future Potential: The project lays a solid foundation for future improvements, such as exploring more advanced algorithms, conducting deeper feature engineering, and implementing cross-validation for more robust model validation.
