# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Objective: Predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques.
Dataset: Utilizes the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Algorithm: Implements logistic regression for binary classification.
Accuracy: Achieves an accuracy of 87% on both training and testing sets.
Key Features: Identifies significant predictors such as age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate achieved.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score to evaluate model performance.
Future Work: Plans to explore advanced algorithms, perform deeper feature engineering, and implement cross-validation for robust validation.
